# CompTIA Network+ Cybersecurity Foundations

## Overview

This repository documents my structured study of CompTIA Network+ concepts with a cybersecurity-focused perspective.

The goal of this repository is to build strong networking foundations while aligning the knowledge with real-world security operations and SOC-level awareness.

This documentation reflects hands-on practice, structured theory, and practical command-line demonstrations.
