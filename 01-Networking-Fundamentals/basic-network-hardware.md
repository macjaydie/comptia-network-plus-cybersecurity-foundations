# Basic Network Hardware

Understanding physical network devices is essential for troubleshooting and security.

---

## Router

Function:
Connects different networks.

Responsibilities:
- Routing traffic
- NAT
- DHCP services (home networks)

Security relevance:
- Misconfigured routers expose networks
- Default credentials are common attack vector

---

## Switch

Connects devices within a LAN.

Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link).

Security risks:
- MAC flooding
- VLAN hopping

---

## Firewall

Filters traffic based on rules.

Types:
- Hardware firewall
- Software firewall
- Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)

---

## Access Point (AP)

Provides wireless connectivity.

Security considerations:
- WPA2/WPA3 configuration
- Disable WPS
- Strong passphrasing

---

## Modem

Connects LAN to ISP.

---

## IDS / IPS

Intrusion Detection System:
Monitors traffic.

Intrusion Prevention System:
Monitors and blocks traffic.

---

## Why This Matters

SOC analysts frequently investigate:

- Misconfigured firewalls
- Rogue access points
- Unauthorized devices
