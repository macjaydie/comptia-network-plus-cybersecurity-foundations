## What is IDS?

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and generates alerts.

IDS does not block traffic.

- Signature-based detection
- Anomaly-based detection
- Behavior-based detection

---

## Deployment Types

- Network-based (NIDS / NIPS)
- Host-based (HIDS / HIPS)

## Security Relevance

IDS/IPS systems:
- Detect attacks in real time
- Generate alerts for SOC analysts
- Require tuning to reduce false positives
