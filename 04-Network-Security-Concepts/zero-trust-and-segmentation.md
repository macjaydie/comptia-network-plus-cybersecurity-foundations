# Zero Trust and Network Segmentation

## Zero Trust Model

Zero Trust assumes no device or user is trusted by default.

Core principles:
- Verify explicitly
- Least privilege
- Assume breach

---

## Network Segmentation

Dividing a network into smaller segments to limit access.

Examples:
- VLANs
- Firewall zones
- Microsegmentation

---

## Security Benefits

- Limits lateral movement
- Reduces blast radius
- Improves incident containment

SOC analysts rely on segmentation to understand attack paths.
