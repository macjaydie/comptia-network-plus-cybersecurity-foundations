# IPv6 Basics

## Why IPv6 Exists

IPv4 exhaustion led to the development of IPv6.

IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses.

Example:
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

## Key Differences from IPv4

- Larger address space
- No broadcast (uses multicast)
- Simplified header
- Built-in IPsec support

---

## IPv6 Format

Hexadecimal notation
Eight groups separated by colons

Can be shortened:
Remove leading zeros
Use :: for consecutive zero blocks

---

## Security Considerations

- Many networks do not monitor IPv6 traffic properly
- Dual-stack environments increase attack surface
- Firewalls must support IPv6 rules
